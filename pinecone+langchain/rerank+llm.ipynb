Even if the assessee is entitled to claim a refund or get it adjusted against the tax liability, they cannot withhold the TDS deducted. If they do, the provisions of s. 40(a)(ia) are attracted. Furthermore, failure to deposit TDS into the Government account is not accepted as a reasonable cause for non-issue of certificate in Form No. 16A, and penalty under s. 272A(2)(g) is leviable for default in issuing TDS certificate even if tax is not deposited.'"
